# inter-esp32-i2c-communication-blinky
Demonstration of I2C communication protocol using two ESP32 modules, both with in-built button & LEDs.

## ℹ️ Overview
This project demonstrates the use of I2C communication protocol to establish packet transfers between two ESP32 modules. The ESP32 modules used:
1. ESP32-wroom-32: Built in LED (GPIO 2) and button (GPIO 0).
2. ESP32-c6: Built in LED (GPIO 8) and button (GPIO 9)
When buttons are pressed on each of the ESP32s, the LEDs in the attached ESP32 blinks / changes colors.
